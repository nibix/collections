/**
 * Specialized data structure which models a set of elements, which can be checked and unchecked. Initially, all elements will be unchecked.
 * You can use the check() and related methods to mark one or more elements as checked. You can use the isComplete() method to check whether
 * all elements are checked. There are additional methods, which allow you to retrieve the checked and unchecked elements.
 * <p>
 * The implementation aims at runtime CPU efficiency. Checking/unchecking single elements is possible in constant (O(1)) time.
 * <p>
 * The implementation is not thread safe. Objects of this class are not meant to be shared between threads.
 * <p>
 * The data structure does not support null elements. The element class must implement hashCode() and equals().
