/**
 * Specialized data structure which models a two-dimensional matrix. Each cell of the matrix can be marked as checked or unchecked.
 * Initially, all cells will be unchecked. The matrix is defined by supplying a set of row elements and a set of column elements. Each
 * cell can be addressed by a row element and a column element.
 *
 * You can use the check() and related methods to mark one or more cells as checked. You can use the isComplete() method to check whether
 * all cells are checked. There are additional methods, which allow you to retrieve the checked and unchecked cells.
 *
 * The implementation aims at runtime CPU efficiency. Checking/unchecking single cells is possible in constant (O(1)) time.
 *
 * The implementation is not thread safe. Objects of this class are not meant to be shared between threads.
 *
 * The data structure does not support null rows or null columns.  The element class must implement hashCode() and equals().
